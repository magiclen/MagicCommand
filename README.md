MagicCommand
=================================

# Introduction

**MagicCommand** is a Java library which is used for running any programs by commands.

# Usage

## Command Class

**Command** class is in the *org.magiclen.magiccommand* package. It can help you run system commands in Java.

### Initialize

You have to input your command to construct **Command** object. For example, if you want to `ping` some host IP, such as `8.8.8.8` for Google Public DNS. You can write the code below,

    final String commandString = "ping 8.8.8.8";
    final Command command = new Command(commandString);

### Run command

You can use **run** method or **runAsync** method to run the command in your **Command** object. Certainly, **run** method is
synchronous and **runAsync** method is asynchronous. One **Command** object can make more than 1 command tasks(processes). Each of them has an unique task ID to recognize. For example, run an asynchronous command task and set its ID to `first`.

    command.runAsync("first");

### Monitor your command tasks

You can use **setCommandListener** method the add your listener to monitor your command tasks before you run all of the command tasks.

    command.setCommandListener(new CommandListener() {

    	    @Override
    	    public void commandStart(final String id) {
    	    }

    	    @Override
    	    public void commandRunning(final String id, final String message, final boolean isError) {
    		      System.out.println(message);
    	    }

    	    @Override
    	    public void commandException(final String id, final Exception exception) {
    		      exception.printStackTrace(System.out);
    	    }

    	    @Override
    	    public void commandEnd(final String id, final int returnValue) {
    	    }
    	});

### Input data to your command task

You can input string data to any command task found by task ID when it is running. For example, input `exit` text to the command task whose ID is `first`,

    command.inputStringToRunningProcess("first", "exit\n");

### Stop your command task

To stop a command task found by task ID `first`,

    command.stop("first");

To stop all the command tasks,

    command.stopAll();
